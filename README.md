## Overview

`p-board` aims to be an extremely fast replacement for TensorBoard, focusing on rapid metric visualization and interaction. It provides a simple yet powerful interface to monitor various metrics from your machine learning experiments, allowing you to quickly get insights from your data. Key design goals include minimal overhead, instant filtering, and smooth rendering of many data points.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   üöÄ **High-Performance Plotting:** Utilizes `webgl-plot` for GPU-accelerated rendering of time-series data, enabling smooth visualization of large datasets.
*   üêô **Hydra Integration:** Automatically displays corresponding Hydra configurations for runs, supporting both single-run and multi-run (Hydra `multirun`) setups for easy correlation of metrics with experiment parameters.
*   üìÇ **Metric Grouping:** Organizes related metrics into collapsible groups for a cleaner and more manageable view.
*   üîç **Advanced Filtering:**
    *   Instantly search for metrics by name within and across groups.
    *   Utilize regular expressions (e.g., `loss|accuracy`, `^group_name/.*_mean$`) for complex filtering needs.
*   üìê **Responsive Layout:** Plots and dashboard elements dynamically resize to fit your browser window.
*   üìä **Hyperparameter Display:** Integrates with TensorBoard HParams to display experiment configurations alongside metrics.
*   ‚öôÔ∏è **TensorBoard Compatibility:** The data loading mechanism is designed to be fully compatible with event files generated by standard TensorBoard loggers (e.g., from PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX).

## ‚ö° Achieving Speed: How p-board is Fast

`p-board` is engineered for speed through several key architectural choices:

*   **WebGL-Powered Charts:** Leverages `webgl-plot` to offload rendering to the GPU, drastically improving performance when displaying many data points or frequent updates compared to traditional SVG or Canvas2D libraries.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript & Minimal Dependencies:** Avoids heavy frameworks and excessive dependencies, resulting in a small bundle size, fast parse times, and quick startup.
*   **Efficient Client-Side Operations:** All filtering, metric searching, and UI updates are performed efficiently in the browser, providing immediate feedback.
*   **Optimized Data Handling:**
    *   **Backend Log Processing & Caching:** The `p-board` backend efficiently parses TensorBoard event files. It can implement strategies like periodic rescanning, caching of processed data, and on-demand loading to ensure quick access for the frontend.
    *   **Efficient Data Structures:** Uses appropriate data structures on both backend and frontend for storing and accessing metric data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
*   **Charting Library:** webgl-plot
*   **Data Source:** The `p-board` backend directly processes TensorBoard event log files. The frontend then fetches this structured data from the backend via an internal API (typically `/data`).

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get `p-board` running locally.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
*   The `p-board` application/executable.

### Installation

You can install `p-board` directly from the repository using pip:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/p-doom/p-board.git
```
Alternatively, you can clone the repository locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/p-doom/p-board.git
cd p-board
pip install .
```

### Data Source

`p-board` directly processes TensorBoard log files. All you need to do is tell `p-board` where to find them.

*   **Specify Log Directory:** When you run `p-board`, use the `--logdir` argument to point to the directory containing your TensorBoard event files (e.g., `events.out.tfevents.*`). `p-board` will automatically scan this directory, process the logs, and serve the data to the web interface.
    ```bash
    # Example:
    p-board --logdir /path/to/your/tensorboard_logs
    ```
    You can also specify multiple runs or named log directories if `p-board` supports it (e.g., `p-board --logdir run1:/path/to/run1,run2:/path/to/run2`).

The `p-board` backend handles all the parsing and makes the data available to the frontend seamlessly. The frontend, by default, fetches this processed data from an internal `/data` endpoint.

### Running `p-board`

`p-board` includes a backend server that processes your TensorBoard log files and serves the web interface.

1.  **Start the `p-board` Backend:**
    Run the backend script, providing the path to your TensorBoard log directory using the `--logdir` argument.
    ```bash
    p-board --logdir /path/to/your/tensorboard_logs
    ```
    For example, if your TensorBoard logs are in a directory named `results/tensorboard`:
    ```bash
    p-board --logdir results/tensorboard
    ```
    You can also specify the port (e.g., `--port 8080`) and the Hydra single/multirun directory (e.g., `--hydra-log-dir path/to/hydra/outputs/singlerun/` or `--hydra-multirun-dir /path/to/your/hydra/multirun/`) if needed. Refer to `p_board/backend.py` for all available options (`python -m p_board.backend --help`).
    ```bash
    p-board --logdir results/tensorboard --port 8080 --hydra-multirun-dir path/to/hydra/outputs/multirun/
    ```
2.  **Open in Browser:** Once the server is running, it will typically print the URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5001`). Open this URL in your web browser.

## üìñ Usage

Once `p-board` is running and has loaded data:

*   **View Metrics:** Metrics are organized into groups. Click on a group title to expand or collapse its plots.
*   **Filter Metrics:**
    *   Use the search box at the top of the page.
    *   **Simple Search:** Type parts of a metric name or group name (e.g., `loss`, `actor`).
    *   **Regex Search:** For more complex patterns, use JavaScript-compatible regular expressions.
        *   Example: `return|value` will show metrics containing either "return" OR "value".
        *   Example: `^actor/.*rate$` will match metrics starting with "actor/" and ending with "rate".
    *   The filter applies globally across all metric groups.
*   **No Metrics Found:** If your filter results in no visible metrics, a message "No metrics found matching 'your_filter'." will be displayed.
